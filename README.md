Exam Seating Arrangement System

Overview:

The Exam Seating Arrangement System is a software application designed to efficiently manage and organize the seating arrangements for students during examinations. The system leverages Java for its application logic and user interface, while a DBMS (such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or any other relational database) is used for data storage and management. This system aims to simplify the process of assigning seats, manage exam schedules, and handle student data while ensuring that seating arrangements are both efficient and fair.
